# Preparing for technical interviews

Interviews for software development roles are known to be notoriously hard. This is because companies are trying to ascertain the competency level of their job applicants. 

## Types of interviews

### Take home project

You will be asked to complete a project within a set amount of time (typically a couple of days).

These projects could be to build a frontend web application that consumes a public API. Interviewers will be looking at how you design and implement your app. These are more common for frontend developer roles.  

#### Challenges

0. Build an app that lists movies from the [Open Movie Database](https://www.omdbapi.com)
0. Build an app that consumes one or more of these [public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) in a frontend framework (e.g. Angular, Vue, or React) and use a state management library (e.g. Redux or MobX)

### Domain specific technical interviews

These are questions on concepts of a programming language, protocol, library, or framework.
