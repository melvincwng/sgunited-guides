# Props with Functional Component

Functional components allow for the reuse of components with a similar layout for different data

## Why Functional Components

Functional Components is perhaps the easiest way to create a highly reusable component.
Say we want to create a component that says Hi to various people.
A naive way is to keep repeating the code. (copy and paste!)

```javascript
<div>Hi John Smith</div>
<div>Hi Jane Doe</div>
<div>Hi Peter Pan</div>
<div>Hi Alice</div>
<div>Hi Bob</div>
```

If we want to style the text, we now have

```javascript
<div className="welcome-text">Hi John Smith</div>
<div className="welcome-text">Hi Jane Doe</div>
<div className="welcome-text">Hi Peter Pan</div>
<div className="welcome-text">Hi Alice</div>
<div className="welcome-text">Hi Bob</div>
```

If you want to change the Hi to Hello, you need to search through all the code and edit them one by one.

```javascript
<div className="welcome-text">Hello John Smith</div>
<div className="welcome-text">Hello Jane Doe</div>
<div className="welcome-text">Hello Peter Pan</div>
<div className="welcome-text">Hello Alice</div>
<div className="welcome-text">Hello Bob</div>
```

You might miss out one of the "Hi"s when editing to "Hello".

If we do not create a reusable component for elements that have similar behaviour, the code becomes hard to maintain and it is difficult to tell if the code is behaving consistently.

## Passing value to functional component

Having a reusable component comes with lots of flexibility.
We can group common behaviours to a single place and allow the modification of code in one place.

```javascript
function WelcomeText(props) {
  return <div className="welcome-text">Hello {props.name}</div>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <WelcomeText name="John Smith" />
      <WelcomeText name="Jane Doe" />
      <WelcomeText name="Peter Pan" />
      <WelcomeText name="Alice" />
      <WelcomeText name="Bob" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Sidenote:

It is nice to keep things **DRY**(Don't Repeat Yourself) and have reusable components but ensure that the components are rightfully designed to have similar behaviour or appearance - the behaviour and appearance are not just concidentally similar. I.E. if a username and shopping cart item have the same style and format, it would still be better to separate them to use separate components and apply the same style as they work independently and are likely to change independently from one another.

It is sometimes more readable to destructure out the value in a Component.

```javascript
function WelcomeText({ name }) {
  return <div className="welcome-text">Hello {name}</div>;
}
```

Recall how to perform destructuring:

```javascript
const props = {
  name,
};

const { name } = props;
```

Similarly, we can rename a variable to improve clarity when necessary.

```javascript
function WelcomeText({ name: username }) {
  return <div className="welcome-text">Hello {username}</div>;
}
```

## Lab: Pokemon

1. Pokemon Component

- git clone https://github.com/thoughtworks-jumpstart/pokemon-react-lab
- In App.js, create a component `PokemonCard` to return a Pokemon's image and states.
- Style the component

2. Change content to your repo

- Create a new Github repo and set the origin:

```sh
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin <your repo here, i.e. git@github.com:john-smith/pokemon-gallery>
```

Now you can push your commits to your own repo:

```sh
git push -u origin master
```

3. Moving component to separate file

- Create a new file "components/PokemonCard.js"
- move pokemon card component into the file

4. PokemonGallery

- Create a new file "components/PokemonGallery.js"
- import PokemonCard into the component
- import data from "pokemon/pokemon.js"
- Create a PokemonGallery component that renders out all the pokemon.
- import PokemonGallery from App.js and use the component.
