1. Follow the instructions in each file (e.g. 1-functions.js, 2-arrays.js, 3-objects.js, etc.) and make all the test cases pass.
1. Run tests using `node <filename>.js`, e.g. `node 1-functions.js`. With `assertHelper`'s `assertEqual` implementation, we will be able to see a list of passing and/or failing test cases. When all test cases are green (passing), you're good to go!
