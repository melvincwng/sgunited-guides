# Circle Ci

## Introduction

Manual deployment involves running through all the steps of checking lint, testing, security scans, build, setting up the environment, running e2e test, provisioning network access or data, etc. It is a tedious and error-prone job.

### Overhead of doing manual deployment

<img src="delivering-software/_media/manualOverhead.png" alt="manual deployment" width="800"/>

Modern CD tools will take care of all these manual work for us once we create a pipeline.

A pipeline is a workflow that runs jobs we can configure. For example if we have three jobs: run lint checks, run unit test, deploy to Heroku. We can set the pipeline to run lint checks, if pass, we then run the unit test, and again if pass, we then deploy to Heroku.

Circle CI is simple to use, provides excellent features and has a free tier.

## CircleCI setup

Signup CircleCI with your GitHub account.
https://circleci.com/signup/.

Signing up with GitHub also gives CircleCI rights to access your repo and allow you to configure a new project.

Click on the `Add projects` tab on the left and add a project.

![manual deployment](_media/circleci-addProject.png)

Look for the GitHub repo and select "Set Up Project".

You will see a sample `config.yml` generated for you.

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:7.10
    working_directory: ~/repo
    steps:
      - checkout
      - restore_cache:
          keys:
            - v1-dependencies-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
            - v1-dependencies-
      - run: npm install
      - save_cache:
          paths:
            - node_modules
          key: v1-dependencies-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
      - run: npm test
```

### YAML

Files with this `.yml` extensions are YAML files.

YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language", like JSON and XML, is another way of presenting your data and a serializable language.

Position of the indentation is crucial in YAML.
The data representation below, in JSON and YAML, are equivalent.

```json
{
  "person": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "age": 17,
    "hobbies": ["fencing", "basket ball", "reading", "running"],
    "contacts": [
      {
        "name": "Alice",
        "mobile": 6353535
      },
      {
        "name": "Bob",
        "mobile": 67773777
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```yaml
person:
  firstName: John
  lastName: Smith
  age: 17
  hobbies:
    - fencing
    - basket ball
    - reading
    - running
  contacts:
    - name: Alice
      mobile: 6353535
    - name: Bob
      mobile: 67773777
```

### Docker

CircleCI uses docker.

Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualisation to deliver software in packages called containers. - Wikipedia

Docker works like a VM (Virtual Machine) and gives us an environment that we can run our application in. In Docker term, this environment is called a "Container".

Docker doesn't know about what our application does and will not recognise the dependencies we need. For docker to create a container that has the dependencies, we will need a docker image. A Docker image is the prewritten instructions or blueprints to create a Container. Ideally, we want a Container that already can run Node, and has access to git. CircleCI has already written the images for us. All we need to do is tell CircleCI which Docker Image to use.

```yaml
build:
  docker:
    - image: circleci/node:12.16
```

We can specify a working directory where all our files in the Docker container will be. It is generally a good idea to put all your files in a folder within docker. `working_directory: ~/repo`

### Workflow

By default, CircleCI runs all your job sequentially. We can tell CircleCI specifically how we want to run the jobs using workflow.

The below workflow tells CircleCI to run two jobs, "test" and "deploy". "deploy" will only start to run after "test" runs successfully.

```yaml
workflows:
  version: 2
  run:
    jobs:
      - test
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - test
```

### Deploying to Heroku (optional)

ðŸ’¡ **Alternative: In the Heroku dashboard under "deploys", you can enable automatic deploys from your `main` branch and check "Wait for CI to pass before deploy".**

Sidenote: Please make sure the application is already working, and you can push the app to Heroku manually. On local: `git push heroku master` and verify the application works.

Heroku stores the code we deploy in their git repository. Using the `git push` and by specifying the API_KEY and APP_NAME, we can trigger a git push to Heroku from anywhere.

```yaml
deploy:
  working_directory: ~/app
  docker:
    - image: buildpack-deps:trusty
  steps:
    - checkout
    - run:
        name: Deploy Master to Heroku
        command: git push https://heroku:$HEROKU_API_KEY@git.heroku.com/$HEROKU_APP_NAME.git master
```

To find the API KEY, Install Heroku CLI and login and create a key.

```bash
heroku login
heroku authorisations:create
```

Add the key/token into the CircleCI environment variable, so it has access to it.

On your next push, you will see the jobs in action in the CircleCI dashboard.
