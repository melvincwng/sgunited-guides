# Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery

## Content

1. Definition of Done (DOD)
2. Continuous Integration (CI)
3. Continuous Delivery (CD)

## Definition of Done

An agreement on what needs to be completed before a story is fully completed and ready to be shipped to the user. The agreement is set by all stakeholders (Developers(Dev), Quality Analyst (QA), Business Analyst (BA), Product Owner (PO)).

### Benefit

1. DOD gives everyone in the team the same expectations on what is included and what is not in a user story.
2. Gives team more clarity during estimations on how much a team can likely complete
3. Setting the right expectations for PO, to provide some clarity as to why certain features may require more time.
4. Prevent rework and arguments on why certain things were not covered.

### Common DOD includes but not limited to

1. All acceptance criteria (AC) is completed
2. Code does not break any linting rules
3. Unit test coverage higher than a certain percentage
4. Code has been reviewed by at least 1 other core team member
5. All behaviours and edge cases are tested by QA
6. The PO understands the scope of the changes and have verified them

### Side Note:

1. DOD should contain things that are only really required by the story
2. Not all stories will have the same DOD
3. A common misbelief that DOD is only for the developer. This is not true. All other members should help to achieve DOD when possible.

Examples:

- User story should be clearly written (INVEST). Developer should have full clarity before starting a task. PO should be available to clarify and verify any requirements.
- If a test is failing, QA can help to identify which part of the code is causing issues.
- If the DOD includes other test (not unit test), QA could potentially help.
- If AC includes data extraction, BA or PO can work on tasks involving extracting data from the database.

## Continuous Integration

A software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.

### Benefits

1. Prevents developers from changing so much code from the main branch that it becomes difficult and expensive to combine the code ("Merge Hell").
2. The reduction in integration problems allows the team to move more smoothly.
3. When your teammate integrates code in small chunks, it allows you to foresee how your code can integrate with what your colleagues are working and prompt important discussions on potential problems much earlier in the development process.

### How it is done

1. Find the smallest logical requirement.
2. Develop the requirement by repeatedly writing test, new code and apply refactoring.
3. Run all the test locally and make sure everything passes
4. Integrate the code by pushing to the repo
5. An automated build gets triggered and run test in _development_ environment
6. Monitor the build, if the build fails, prioritise to fix the build immediately and get as much help as required(other team member should also prioritise to fix the build if asked to help). If the fix will take time, revert the code to a working state, fix the changes then repeat.

## Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time. [martinfowler.com](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html)

Youâ€™re doing continuous delivery when:

1. Your software is deployable throughout its lifecycle
2. Your team prioritizes keeping the software deployable over working on new features
3. Anybody can get fast, automated feedback on the production readiness of their systems any time somebody makes a change to them
4. You can perform push-button deployments of any version of the software to any environment on demand

### Create an automated deployment pipeline that

1. Build executable
2. Deploy to server
3. Run automated test in a _production like_ environment. Typically also running end to end test.

### Benefits

1. With incremental changes in code, we can easily identify the necessary changes needed to be done in the deployment pipeline for a successful deployment.
2. Fast feedback from user and stakeholders, more often than not, we might build a system that we thought will help the user but it actually doesn't. Fast deployment cycle allow companies to get feedback from the user faster.
